The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada has declared the operation of sternwheeler snag-boats by the Department of Public works on the rivers of British Columbia an event of national historic significance and in the future intends to commemorate this by means of a plaque installed on or near the Samson V, the last representative example of these vessels. The Samson V was retired in 1980 and sold to the City of New Westminster for one dollar on the understanding that the vessel would be preserved as a museum and that it occupy a unique place in the Province's and City's maritime heritage.

This historic dwelling is notable for its Period Revival architecture with complex steeply-pitched rooflines, built-in flower boxes and tall internal red-brick chimney. Built in 1938, the Alan & Edith Webster Residence is significant for its Period Revival architecture. The period between the two World Wars was a time of entrenched traditionalism in residential architecture in North America. Houses were expected to display historical motifs as a reflection of the owners’ good taste, harkening back to a romantic representation of traditional domestic values and an idyllic suburban lifestyle. This house displays only a cautious embrace of modernism, and includes Period Revival elements, such as complex steeply-pitched rooflines, built-in flower boxes, and a mixture of diamond leaded casement windows and multi-paned double-hung windows that demonstrate a vestigial influence of the British Arts and Crafts style. An efficient and rational floor plan with smaller rooms arranged around a central living room, reflected the reality that most families, during this period of austerity, could no longer afford domestic help. Further value is attained for this residence’s association with first owners Alan Webster and his wife, Edith. Alan Webster, who studied at the University of British Columbia, was employed as an Engineer with the Canadian Government. This house was constructed by J.

,Armitage House,,,340 Fifth Street,New Westminster,BC,V3L 2X4,Armitage House,"The Armitage House is important in particular for its representation of 1930’s New Westminster and for its architectural style. Built circa 1938, the Armitage House is an excellent example of an English Cottage-style home common to the region and to the country in the 1920s and 30s, but now much less familiar. It is strongly reminiscent of the catalogue houses that were offered in North America by the Sears Modern Homes Program (1908-1940). The design of this house is interesting for being remarkably similar to the 'Yates Model 3711', which the Sears catalogue described as 'a mellow house, pleasantly flavored with English-cottage characteristics.' The English Cottage design was popular with the emerging middle class (to which the Armitages belonged) as it was both attractive and affordable. It espoused the Arts and Crafts movement through its design elements, such as an asymmetrical façade, a window pattern that reflects the interior room functions, orientation of the house to take advantage of natural lighting, minimal use of picturesque detail, and the overall design emphasis of function showing through design. This house is significant for having very few changes in the original exterior design elements, making it easily readable as a 1930’s catalogue English Cottage home. The location of the house on the edge of comfortable Queen’s Park speaks to an upwardly-mobile family, and the house itself is a physical connection to the George Armitage family. George was important to New Westminster as the long-time manager of the Valley Lumber Company.",152,3,,,,-1,"The Armitage House is a two-storey house built in the English Cottage style, situated on a corner residential lot in the historic Queen’s Park.

The house, which features a hipped roof, a projecting corner bay and a wraparound verandah, is a landmark house in the Queen's Park neighbourhood in New Westminster. Constructed during a period of substantial growth in New Westminster, Bunachie is valued as an illustration of the Edwardian-era development of the historic Queen's Park neighbourhood, the most affluent and desirable residential area of New Westminster. The historic character of Queen's Park is based on its consistent streetscapes of fine restored homes, augmented by mature landscaping. This house is further valued for its association with longtime owners, the McKay family. It was built for Barbara S. McKay in 1905 by her father.  Bunachie is also a superior example of Edwardian-era architecture, reflective of a booming period of prosperity and growth in New Westminster. The design is attributed to well-known local architect, Edwin George William Sait (1867-1949), who immigrated to western Canada in the 1890s. He had a successful career in architecture, including the New Westminster Carnegie Library (1902-04) and several large structures at the Provincial Exhibition grounds in Queen’s Park. The use of a crossed-mullion pattern, as seen in this house, was typical of Sait’s work.

,British Columbia Electric Railway Company,,,774 Columbia Street,New Westminster,BC,V3M 5V2,British Columbia Electric Railway Company,"It was built at the time that the B.C. Electric Railway Company was extending its interurban system east to Chilliwack, to serve the fledgling agricultural communities and forest industries of the Fraser Valley. The 'Market', 'Milk', 'Mail' and 'Owl' trains provided rail links between the metropolitan areas and the upper valley, facilitating rapid development in the sparsely settled lands to the east. The Fraser Valley line opened on November 6, 1910, and established patterns of settlement that, despite the line's closure in 1950, are still evident today. This landmark building was designed in 1909 and constructed in 1910-11, and included offices and the dispatch centre for the interurban system. The design allowed interurban cars to pass though the building diagonally to connect the Front Street and Columbia Street rail tracks though a large opening on Eighth Street. Its location opposite the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) station integrated local, regional and national transportation systems. Additionally, the BCER Company building is significant for its contribution to the consistent and distinctive built form of Columbia and Front Streets, which dates from 1898 to 1913, when New Westminster was the major centre of commerce and industry for the booming Fraser Valley area. Further heritage value lies in the building's architecture, designed by the prominent Vancouver-based architectural firm Maclure and Fox, the partnership of Samuel Maclure (1860-1929) and Cecil Croker Fox (1879-1916) who were best known for their numerous prestigious residential projects.",154,3,,,,-1,"The heritage value of the BCER Company building is associated with the development of regional commuter and freight transportation, and the increasing importance of New Westminster as a transportation and distribution hub in the Lower Mainland.",Heritage,-122.9107943415,49.2011891918872

,Columbia Theatre,,,530 Columbia Street,New Westminster,BC,V3L 1B2,Columbia Theatre,"The eclectic ornamentation of the exterior reflects the exoticism of the popular Period Revival styles, promoted by Hollywood as appropriate for neighbourhood movie palaces. These romantic themes were carried into the interior. Murals of romantic Mediterranean scenery, lanterns, plaster screens, wrought iron trellis work covered with climbing roses and twinkling stars in a midnight sky gave the patrons the illusion of being seated in an exotic walled garden. In the 1920s movies were becoming the premier form of popular entertainment; the Columbia Theatre is valued as a local representation of the growth of this Hollywood phenomenon. In 1912, Adolph Zukor established the Famous Players Film Company, which merged four years later with the Jesse L. Lasky Company to form the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation; their film distribution company was named Paramount Pictures. The Columbia was operated as part of this chain for the duration of its life as a movie theatre.  Additionally, the Columbia Theatre is valued for its architecture. Its architects, Fred Laughton Townley (1887-1966) and Robert Michael Matheson (1887-1935) were best known for their design of Vancouver City Hall. In the inter-war period this firm flourished as one of the leaders in the use of traditional period revival styles as well as in their exploration of modernism, particularly in their sophisticated institutional work. After the construction of the Columbia Theatre, Townley and Matheson became the local architects for Famous Players.

It is located on a steeply sloped site on the south side of Columbia Street, the main commercial street in New Westminster's historic downtown core, at the corner of McKenzie Street. The rear of the building faces Front Street, where the sloping site exposes the lower level, and provides the opportunity for a secondary storefront. The Dupont Block is significant for its contribution to the consistent and distinctive built form of Columbia and Front Streets, which dates from 1898 to 1913, when New Westminster was the major centre of commerce and industry for the booming Fraser Valley area. A three-storey brick and stone block was completed on this site in 1891, designed by architect G.W. Grant for Victoria investors D.R. Harris and Major Charles T. Dupont. After its destruction in the Great Fire of 1898, Dupont financed a replacement two-storey block, also designed by Grant, that incorporated the still-standing walls of the earlier structure. Completed in 1899, this was one of the largest ground floor areas covered by a single building in the province. The Dupont Block was designed in the Victorian Italianate style, with a chamfered corner entry and arched window hoods. The exterior of the building was finished in a mortar stucco to disguise the fire-ravaged walls of the earlier building. In 1910, the western portion of the building was redeveloped as the Edison Theatre. The Dupont Block is additionally valued for its association with its architect George William Grant (1852-1925), a prolific architect, who designed many of the buildings in downtown New Westminster, before and after the Great Fire.

It is located on a prominent corner lot on Royal Avenue, with its front entrance facing Park Row. Built in 1891-92, English Corners is valued as an excellent and early local example of the British Arts and Crafts movement of the Late Victorian era. Prevalent throughout Britain in the mid to late-nineteenth century, the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement was just beginning to reach British Columbia at this time, and strongly affected the architects of this house, English-born Richard Prior Sharp (born 1859) and New Westminster native, Samuel Maclure (1860-1929). Maclure is remembered as the leading residential architect in British Columbia in the early twentieth century, and as a staunch proponent of Arts and Crafts design. The overall complex massing, cross-gabled roofline, half-timbered gables and varied claddings reflect traditional British antecedents, and the Arts and Crafts aesthetic is reflected in the construction, using locally-available building materials, and in the fine craftsmanship and materials, including ornate scroll-work and brackets on the exterior, and a functional and beautiful interior with intricate woodwork.

Furthermore, the Frank & Leah Purvis Residence is valued as an example of Period Revival architecture and illustrates a conscious shift to a simpler style, facilitated by the social and economic consciousness of the interwar period. At the time, houses were expected to display some sort of historical reference in order to demonstrate the owner’s good taste. This was especially important in the more prestigious neighbourhoods such as Queen’s Park and demonstrates an underlying conservatism in this tightly-knit neighbourhood. An efficient and rational floor plan, including rooms closely arranged around a central hallway, reflected the reality that most families could no longer afford domestic help.

Built in 1913, the Furness Residence is significant as an outstanding example of an Edwardian-era Arts and Crafts residence. Designed by architect Edmund John Boughen (1874-1967), he built this grand house at a cost of $4,000.

Popular during the late Victorian era, this style was characterized by asymmetrical, picturesque massing and rooflines, and elaborate surface articulation with a variety of cladding textures including shingles and siding. The design of this house, with its prominent corner turret with an iron finial, hipped roof with lower cross gables and wraparound verandah, was inspired by a design by New York architect H. Hudson Holly, found in a popular pattern book, ""Detail, Cottage and Constructive Architecture"", printed by New York publisher, William T. Comstock in 1886.

Substantial portions of these two houses were relocated and joined through the use of a consistent new roofline and a new central entry. Despite the different styles of the two earlier houses, the resulting composition is remarkably harmonious, employing Classical Revival elements to visually unite the ornate and varied detailing.  Additionally, the Gilley Residence is valued for its associated with Herbert Gilley (1862-1941), who owned the original circa 1890 Queen Anne portion of the building, and subdivided the former Hendry estate to move his home from the adjacent property and sell the other lots as a high-class subdivision in 1912. Gilley was a partner, with his brother, Walter R. Gilley, in Gilley Bros., a successful lumber and cartage company. Gilley Street in New Westminster was named after the brothers.

This house, one of the earliest in this neighbourhood, was built in 1890 for Alexander M. Hennessey, who worked as a boot and shoemaker on Columbia Street. The site was relatively remote from downtown, but was desirable due to its location across from Moody Square (now Moody Park), and for its panoramic views south to the Fraser River. Hennessey and his family of six occupied the house until 1894; he died at the age of 70 in 1902.

In order to display good taste, it was expected that a house would have an identifiable period revival style. As economics dictated that houses of the time were generally modest, they often assumed a cottage appearance that provided a romantic ideal of traditional domesticity, harkening back to the values and ideals of an earlier age. The American Sesquicentennial in 1926 reinforced this historicist trend, and the most popular Hollywood movies of the time were swashbuckling costume dramas. This romantic influence is demonstrated in the asymmetrical roofline, which swoops in a 'catslide' over the front entry, multi-paned windows and rustic materials. The first owners of the house were John B. Chamberlain (1832-1956) and his wife Annie (1883-1944). Originally from St. Norbert, Manitoba, John was employed as a mechanic with the British Columbia Electric Railway Company. The Chamberlains had five children before moving in 1915. The house was acquired by the Denchel family, then in 1921 by Frederick and Margaret Spooner.",203,3,,,,-1,"Built in 1910-11 and altered in subsequent renovations in 1937 and 1941, the John & Annie Chamberlain Residence is valued as a picturesque example of a Storybook Cottage residence.

The twin Maria Keary Cottages (Maria Keary Cottages 1 and 2) are valued as unique examples of early purpose-built rental accommodation, likely the oldest such examples in mainland British Columbia, and illustrate the origins and evolution of local residential design. The historic value of these two cottages is further enhanced as they are among the few extant buildings that survived the Great Fire of 1898, which destroyed much of downtown New Westminster. Furthermore, these twin cottages provide a rare surviving demonstration of the entrepreneurial spirit of pioneer women, an often overlooked aspect of early community settlement. Maria Keary (1824-1911) was an Irish immigrant who arrived in New Westminster in 1860 to join her husband, James Keary, a Royal Engineer. Widowed in 1871, Maria supported her family by running the family home as a boarding house. To further supplement her income, in 1887 she purchased a lot and financed the construction of these two cottages as rental properties.

Constructed at the height of the local building boom in 1911, the McClughan Residence is a testament to the Edwardian-era development of the Brow of the Hill neighbourhood. Initially conceived by Colonel Moody as a neighbourhood for the working classes, Brow of the Hill is characterized by its steep topography and expansive views of the Fraser River. The neighbourhood began to develop in the late 1880s with the construction of modest homes, attracting buyers who worked downtown. The sustained industrial and business activity in New Westminster’s core continued to spur residential development during the Edwardian era. During the First World War, the area was home to many factory workers employed in the North Arm waterfront area. The first owners of this vernacular house were the McClughan family. John Carr McClughan (1875-1920) was a plumber, and partner in James & McClughan, Plumbing & Heating Contractors. Born in Ontario, John married Mary Mae Flumerfelt in 1902.

In 1948 the theatre was leased to Paramount-Famous Players, who completed interior and exterior renovations, including a new neon sign with the name Paramount Theatre.

It was one of the tallest structures built on the south side of Columbia Street during the Edwardian-era and remains a landmark in the area. The front of the structure is six storeys high on Columbia Street; the rear facade, which faces Front Street, has seven exposed storeys. The heritage value of the Trapp Block is directly associated with the Edwardian-era development of downtown New Westminster, marking a formative period in B.C.'s resource-based economy. After the devastation of the Great Fire of 1898, the downtown was rebuilt immediately and continued to develop during the great western Canadian economic boom that preceded the First World War. The Trapp Block is a landmark structure on Columbia and Front Streets, the city's earliest and most historic area of commercial and institutional buildings. Much of the distinctive built form of Columbia and Front Streets dates from 1898 to 1913, when New Westminster was the major centre of commerce and industry for the booming Fraser Valley area, and served the local resource-based economy.  The Trapp Block is historically significant for its association with the wholesale and retail hardware firm, founded by Thomas and Samuel Trapp in New Westminster in 1880, which by 1914 was one of the largest such firms in Western Canada.",228,3,,,,-1,"The heritage value of the Trapp Block is directly associated with the Edwardian-era development of downtown New Westminster, marking a formative period in B.C.'s resource-based economy.",Heritage,-122.909143714654,49.2020806890279
http://www.newwestcity.ca/database/rte/files/221%20Ninth%20St.pdf,,,,221 Nineth Street,New Westminster,BC,V3M 3V6,Turnbull House,"The Turnbull House is a one-storey, late Victorian-era wood-frame cottage with a hipped roof. A later front-gabled, partial-width entry porch features tapered columns and half-timbering in the gable peak. It is located on Ninth Street in the Brow of the Hill neighbourhood in New Westminster.  Built circa 1888-1889, the Turnbull House is valued for its association with the earliest, Victorian-era development of historic Brow of the Hill. The neighbourhood began to develop in the late 1880s with the construction of modest homes, many of them built on a speculative or rental basis, attracting workers from the downtown area. The Turnbull House was one of the first residences built on Ninth Street. Following the war, a shortage of housing led to many of the neighbourhood’s houses being converted into apartments. The 1920s addition of a prominent front porch demonstrates the house’s evolution over time.  The house is additionally significant for its associations with Scottish-born Thomas Turnbull (1860-1939). Thomas was an accomplished carpenter and building contractor who built many fine homes and commercial buildings in the New Westminster area. After moving to New Westminster, he embarked upon an impressive contracting career, which included the construction of numerous buildings throughout New Westminster and the Fraser Valley. This house was apparently built as a rental property, as Turnbull retained ownership. Its square plan is a simplified version of the house that Turnbull built nearby for his own family.",229,3,,,,-1,"Built circa 1888-1889, the Turnbull House is valued for its association with the earliest, Victorian-era development of historic Brow of the Hill.",Heritage,-122.918812150937,49.2051283007356

Falding Residence is a one-and-one-half storey Queen Anne Revival-style cottage with elaborate wooden detailing, including an asymmetrical front-gabled, projecting semi-octagonal bay and distinctive patterned wood siding. The house is located the east side of Fourth Street in the historic Queen’s Park neighbourhood in New Westminster. The W.H. Falding Residence is significant for its association with the late Victorian-era development of the historic Queen’s Park neighbourhood, the most affluent and desirable residential area of New Westminster. The historic character of Queen’s Park is based on its consistent streetscapes of fine restored homes, augmented by mature landscaping. Built in 1891, the W.H. Falding Residence is also valued as an excellent representation of the Queen Anne Revival style of the late Victorian era. Despite its small scale, this cottage is elaborated through the use of carpenter ornamentation that demonstrated the introduction of new technology at a time when steam-driven band saws, drills and lathes had become readily available. Typical of the Queen Anne style is the complex, irregular form, as expressed through its picturesque roofline and projecting front bay that balances the partial-width front verandah. The first owner was W.H. Falding (1858-1931), Registrar of the Supreme Court of BC, who owned the house until 1907. In the mid 1980s, the house was restored through a grant from the BC Heritage Trust and with help from the New Westminster Heritage Preservation Society.

It is located on the quiet residential street of Fifth Avenue, near Queen's Park. Built in 1912, the Wintemute House is valued as a good example of a Craftsman bungalow, a popular residential style in the early twentieth century. Designed by Vancouver-based architect, William P. White, and constructed by local builder, Burton Smith, the style exhibits an almost complete rejection of classically inspired design details and instead features a rich textural contrast of siding and shingles and plain detailing. The character of the house is enhanced by a surviving Monkey Puzzle tree that was planted circa 1912 as one of a pair flanking the front of the house.  The Wintemute House is associated with Errol Irving Wintemute (1886-1937) and his wife, Martha Jane Wintemute (1886-1972), who lived in this house between 1912 and 1943. Irving Wintemute, who was born in New Westminster, was a mining recorder for the provincial government, with responsibilities including the orderly staking of claims and dispute resolution. Nicknamed ""Punk"", Wintemute became famous in the Royal City when he played for the New Westminster Salmonbellies Lacrosse Club, which won the 1908 Minto Cup championship.

,Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery,anvilbattery@senseofhistory.com,,,,,,Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery,"Communities have always found ways to welcome visitors and to mark special days. In early British Columbia, such occasions were often marked by firing cannons, ringing bells, and three hearty cheers. But another form of recognition was used in BC and other places as well the firing of anvils! The firing of anvils as a form of salute has a long history. In BC they frequently welcomed the arrival of a new stern wheel steamboat. Here and in other places they marked special days and festivities. The process involves placing a little gunpowder between two anvils and igniting it. In the resulting explosion, the top anvil flies upward, a lot of smoke surrounds the park, and the noise is similar to cannon fire. In the late 1800s, a group of men in New Westminster fired an anvil salute to the sovereign when other more recognized means were not available. That annual salute, continued from that time until today, is now carried out by the renowned Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery, to mark Victoria Day in honour of the reigning monarch and the memory of Queen Victoria. The salute has also been fired on special occasions such as a visit by Royalty, and the shots are always carried out in a formal, dignified manner as befits a proper salute.

The upper floors retain their late Victorian-era appearance, while the ground level storefront has been restored to its 1940 Streamline Moderne appearance. It is located on the south side of Columbia Street, the main commercial street in New Westminster's historic downtown core. HERITAGE VALUE: The Holbrook Block is valued for its continued use as a saloon and hotel since 1899. Additionally, the Holbrook Block is significant for its contribution to the consistent and distinctive built form of Columbia Street, which dates from 1898 to 1913, when New Westminster was the major centre of commerce and industry for the booming Fraser Valley area. In the 1880s, Henry Holbrook constructed a brick and stone block facing Columbia Street and the wooden Holbrook Hotel facing Front Street. Both structures were destroyed by the Great Fire in 1898. The following year the Holbrook Estate, managed by local businessman and then Mayor Thomas Ovens, financed this $20,000 brick replacement, dubbed the Holbrook House. The Holbrook Block is also significant for its late Victorian-era architecture, and displays modest Victorian Italianate styling on the upper floors, reflected in its segmented arch window hoods, connected by a continuous horizontal band. The storefront was renovated in 1939-1940, and its Streamline Moderne appearance was recently restored including replica neon signage. The Holbrook Block is valued for its architectural associations. George William Grant (1852-1925), the original architect, designed many of the buildings in downtown New Westminster before and after the Great Fire.

Heritage Value: The Land Registry Office is a significant legacy of New Westminster's role as an administrative centre. The distribution of Crown Land as well as the registration of land transactions was a key function of the colonial government. New Westminster, as the capital of the Mainland Colony, and later as the first capital of the province of British Columbia, was the location of the original Land Registry in 1860. The Land Registry was housed in various offices until the construction of this substantial building during the western boom years, an indication of the volume of land sales at the time.
