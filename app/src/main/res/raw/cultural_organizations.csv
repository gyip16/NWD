,Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery,anvilbattery@senseofhistory.com,,,,,,Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery,"Communities have always found ways to welcome visitors and to mark special days. In early British Columbia, such occasions were often marked by firing cannons, ringing bells, and three hearty cheers. But another form of recognition was used in BC and other places as well the firing of anvils! The firing of anvils as a form of salute has a long history. In BC they frequently welcomed the arrival of a new stern wheel steamboat. Here and in other places they marked special days and festivities. The process involves placing a little gunpowder between two anvils and igniting it. In the resulting explosion, the top anvil flies upward, a lot of smoke surrounds the park, and the noise is similar to cannon fire. In the late 1800s, a group of men in New Westminster fired an anvil salute to the sovereign when other more recognized means were not available. That annual salute, continued from that time until today, is now carried out by the renowned Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery, to mark Victoria Day in honour of the reigning monarch and the memory of Queen Victoria. The salute has also been fired on special occasions such as a visit by Royalty, and the shots are always carried out in a formal, dignified manner as befits a proper salute. Don't miss this proud group in scarlet uniforms reminiscent of an early fire brigade, as they proudly continue an important part of the local cultural heritage and history.",184,5,,,,-1,The Ancient and Honourable Hyack Anvil Battery traces its roots to the 1880s and the community's desire to salute and honour the reigning monarch.
