"The Arundel Mansions building was constructed in 1912 and designed by architects Thornton and Davis of Vancouver. It is constructed of brick and reinforced concrete and has six storeys and a basement. Its Late Victorian architecture features a bank of four 'bay windows' on the upper five floors of both the front and rear facades. The architectural style, with its strong vertical emphasis, provides a pleasant contrast to the horizontal elements in the adjacent College Place Hotel building. The original owner of the Arundel Mansions was G. Alers Hankey who also owned the Russell Hotel at that time. The Mansions building provided 68 apartment residential units and is now a combination of commercial and residential space. The building needs upgrading but its upper facade is very well-preserved. A wide variety of uses are allowed and the Mansions enjoys a location near the Law Courts and Douglas College which makes it attractive for uses to move in which complement the nature of the College/Courts Precinct. In 1988, the new owner of this building completed extensive repairs and renovations to the building. The accommodations were called 'affordable' residential units for inner City residents. The exterior facade was painted a bright 'pink' colour, which aroused considerable comment in the community. ",1901,72,Y,1,454.77313161,116.1287767691,356000,,48,BEGBIE ST,ARUNDAL MANSIONS,1912,G.

"Located at 315 and 321 Carnarvon Street are the Emmanuel Pentecostal Church and Church Hall. The Church Hall was originally St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church and under the pastorship of Rev. R. Jamieson, was the first Presbyterian Church on the British Columbia mainland. This traditional wooden gothic church was built by the contractor A. H. Manson. Rev. R. Jamieson had arrived in New Westminster in 1862. His first congregation was 80 residents who met in the original Clarkson Street Court House prior to the building of the wooden church, the first St. Andrew's. Jamieson lived and operated a school in the manse, originally located on the site of the brick church. In 1898, the church and manse were spared from the 1898 'Great Fire'.

"The Old Courthouse was built in 1891 by George W. Grant, architect. A few years later, the fire of 1898 gutted the building completely. The following year, Grant was commissioned to rebuild the Courthouse by using the original walls and the same general plan. The Victorian Romanesque civic building style features brick and stone construction with a slate roof. The exterior has a red brick facade with carved stone details, arched entrances and windows, and an irregular roofline created by the chateau style roof. The architecture of the Courthouse makes it visually dominant in the Precinct and its roofline, massing, and distinctive brick and stone facade set the historic character for the street. The building is structurally sound and the exterior facade fairly well-preserved. A new entrance was added in 1910, the central front facade was removed in 1914, and the ornamental cornice was removed in the 1960's. The Courthouse is presently vacant and would require extensive renovation for adaptive re-use. Historically, the Courthouse is recognized as one of the most important public structures to be built of permanent materials in the City. It was opened at the Spring Assizes in 1891 by Chief Justice Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, first judge for the colonies and first Chief Justice of British Columbia. The Old Courthouse building represents a tie to the historic administration of justice in the early days of the City and Province.

It provides an excellent example of the Victorian Romanesque style which Grant used in his post-fire buildings. The building is a brick and stone structure with three storeys. The exterior facade features a corner facade and lavish detail including pilasters, entablature, contrast trim, arched windows and entrances, and extensive rusticated stone moldings and trim. The street level facade at Columbia has been covered by siding but the upper, side and rear facades are very well-preserved. The building was originally used by the Masonic Lodge as a temple and was subsequently purchased by F. J. Hart, a real estate and insurance agent.

"The Westminster Trust Building is very important historically because it was the City's first skyscraper. Its towering eight storeys were built on a steel frame in 1912 and designed by architects Gardiner and Mercer. The Trust Building provides an excellent example of Beaux Arts Classical architecture. The exterior features red brick with white terra cotta trim. The interior has granite floors and a light well. The corner site and the building's height contribute to its dominance in the Precinct. It also helps to establish the Begbie St. edge. The building was originally owned by the Westminster Trust and Safe Deposit Company, but is now a strata-titled building.

"The B.C. Electric Railway Station was built in 1911 by architects Maclure and Fox. Its original use was as a tram station and it represents, historically, the development of commuter transportation and the City's first rail connection to Vancouver. The 1911 Edwardian Commercial style building was renovated in the 1950's for commercial retail use. Wosk's Furniture Store changed the exterior facade of the concrete and frame building to an International style, with blue ceramic tiles, white siding and metallic trim.

"The Canadian Pacific Railway Station was built in 1899 to r place the earlier wooden structure which was destroyed in the 1898 fire. In 1887, a spur line was constructed for passenger and freight service between New Westminster and the main line at Westminster Junction (Port Coquitlam). The station is constructed of stone and brick and has two storeys. Its exterior facade features red brick with stone detail and a chateau style roof which produces a unique roofline. The wings were added in 1911 by architects Gardiner and Mercer. During the 1970's, the building was converted to a restaurant called ""The Keg"". The west wing remained as a freight office up to mid-1980, when it was phased out to enable the restaurant to expand throughout the rest of the building.

"In 1878, the Centre Building was the first to be built on the Woodlands site. In that year, thirty six patients were admitted to the twenty eight room institution - then known as the ""lunatic asylum"". The original building was made of brick, two storeys high, and 125 feet long by 25 feet wide. In July 1884, a contract was awarded for improvements and additions to the value of $22,500. This included the construction of, a new north wing to the original 1878 building, which increased the capacity from to 70 beds. The window sills were lowered to improve the external views and the interior lighting. In 1889, an administration building and another wing were added south of the original buildings. Also, the original front structure was widened by twelve feet. In 1897, overcrowding and more residents necessitated the construction of another wing, containing a kitchen, dining room and bathrooms.

"433 Carnarvon Street moved to 121 St. Patrick Street - Captain W. H. Philpott named his c. 1905 home of 433 Carnarvon Street 'Westham' after a village in Essex, England. The name 'Westham' is set in the front walk in octagonal white and black tiles. Captain Philpott came to New Westminster in 1898. His career began as a cook; he then worked as a fireman on a dredge, a dredge operator in 1905, and finally a wharfinger on the Dominion Public Works wharf by 1909. In later years the B. C. directories list him as a master mariner. 'Westham' was built during the Late Victorian Period when there was a return to classical elements and simpler house lines in residential architecture. It was constructed in the Eastern Shingle style being essentially a Neo­Classical Revival row-house, featuring a columned veranda, dominant front gable and side dormer. In May 1990, this house was relocated to a vacant lot at 119 St. Patrick Street, in order to prevent demolition of the building because of an apartment proposal. The new owner intends to renovate the house back to its original condition. 'Westham' also has some Victorian characteristics, including bay windows, ornamental woodwork, sunburst window in the attic, and scalloped shingles in the front gable. Interesting site features include an ornamental iron fence, charming turn of the century children's playhouse, and large metal ice-house at the rear of the property. Captain Philpott's Royal Ice Works at 424 Victoria Street was probably built before 1912 and is the only one in New Westminster listed in the directories at that time.",2614,3519,Y,Sup,182.9531,54.9792530643446,6628000,,121,ST.
